# GPT Final Review — v2 Draft

## What landed
- CLVR section is the biggest upgrade. "Your Files Remember Themselves" at same level as "Start Here" and "Understand Why" — third pillar: tools, memory, files
- "The agent operates on files. You operate on files. Right now those are two separate realities. CLVR makes them one." — clearest articulation of why CLVR matters
- Killing "The Bet" was right. Doc ends on sovereignty now. "The agent owns its toolchain. The human owns the agent. Nobody else is in the loop." — that's the closer
- Lifecycle section cleaner. Prose > table. Mechanics pushed to reference link
- "Most organizations with 10x the headcount don't have this" — flex that earns itself because it's true

## Applied
- Receipt reworked as parenthetical instead of orphaned standalone line
- Feedback files moved to /feedback directory

## Status
Ready for wip.computer.
