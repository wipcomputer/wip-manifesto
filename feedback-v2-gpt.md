# GPT Feedback on Manifesto — Structural Notes for v2

## Three things that make v2 different from v1:

### 1. CLVR needs the Time Warp tease
CLVR is about to become the file memory layer. Manifesto still has it as "macOS utility that auto-timestamps file names." Undersells by an order of magnitude.

Don't reveal the whole vision, but something like: "File versioning for humans. Currently ships timestamps — soon ships time travel." gives people a reason to watch the repo.

Right now it reads like a finished utility. It's actually a trojan horse.

### 2. Kill or rewrite "The Bet" section
Every other section is specific, grounded, pointing at code. Then "The teams that win are the ones building the layer underneath" sounds like a pitch deck.

Don't need it. Sovereignty section carries philosophical weight. Architecture section makes the technical case. "The Bet" tells people what to conclude after you've already shown them. Trust the reader.

### 3. Add the receipt
One line. Universal Interface Spec first commit date vs. Karpathy's "Software in the Age of AI" publish date. Just a footnote or parenthetical. Difference between "riding a wave" and "saw the wave coming."

## Guidance for tightening pass
- The voice is already right
- Risk: making it more polished but less Parker
- The directness — "Five problems. Every team solves them alone." — is what makes it work
- If tightening = more professional → push back
- If tightening = shorter and more precise → lean in
